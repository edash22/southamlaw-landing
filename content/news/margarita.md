Margarita has been coming to the United States regularly for years. Her daughter is now a US citizen, which opened a path for Margarita to obtain permanent residence. She came to Southam Law to prepare for the interview regarding the residency process. Margarita had doubts because immigration officials once gave her problems when she tried to enter the US. Keith helped Margarita to understand what would happen in the interview and helped her to practice a sincere but brief answer to any question about that entry. The goal was to convince the immigration officer of the truth: that the problems of the previous entry would not be a problem in obtaining permanent residency. The strategy worked. Margarita now has a green card and can live permanently in the United States with her daughter and granddaughter!
