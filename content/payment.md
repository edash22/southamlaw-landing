## How to make a payment

<b>QuickPay/Zelle</b>

For QuickPay/Zelle payments, select the option for a “Business” and use the name “Southam Law LLC” and the email address “keith@southamlaw.com”. Add your full legal name in the notes field so our accountant knows this is your payment.

<b>Checks/MoneyOrders</b>

Add your full legal name in the memo field so our accountant knows this is your payment.

<b>Debit or credit card</b>

To pay by debit or credit card, please phone the office at 773-466-4478 or email us. We can take a payment over the phone or email you a link for a payment. If you use a link to pay, please add your full legal name in the memo field so our accountant knows this is your payment.

<b>Cash</b>

To pay by cash, please phone the office at 773-466-4478 to set up an appointment.

## When to make a payment

<b>Consultations</b>: please pay your consultation fee before your consultation meeting (at least 48 hours in advance) or our office will cancel the meeting.

<b>Initial payment</b>: please make an initial payment for a new case before our office can begin work.

<b>Monthly/Recurring payment</b>: please make any monthly or recurring payments payment by the 20th of the month so that your payment shows on your account statement.

## Account Statements/Invoices

<b>First Statement</b>: Within a few days to a week after you sign a contract for services you will receive your first account statement. It will arrive by email from quickbooks@notification.intuit.com. We recommend that you add this email address to your "safe senders" list. We encourage you to make an initial payment as soon as you get the account statement. If you don’t get an account statement after a week, please contact our office by email at info@southamlaw.com.

<b>Monthly Statements</b>: If you have an account balance, near the beginning of each month, you will receive an account statement. It will arrive by email from quickbooks@notification.intuit.com. We recommend that you add this email address to your "safe senders" list. The statement will show the payments you have made recently and the total balance. If you think a payment is missing, let us know right away and send us the receipt with the confirmation number.

## Other Tips

There is no need to email or text us when you make a payment. If you're worried about payments, our best advice is to save your confirmations and compare them to your monthly statement.

Our phone number will not work for QuickPay/Zelle. Our account is registered under the email keith@southamlaw.com.

If you want to set up an automatic payment by credit/debit card, please phone the office at 773-466-4478 to do this.
