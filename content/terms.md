## Why have these Terms and Conditions?

These Terms and Conditions accompany a Legal Partnership Agreement (that is, a contract). If You asked Southam Law LLC to help you with a specific application or case, Southam Law LLC will ask You to sign a Legal Partnership Agreement. These Terms and Conditions give more detailed rules to the Legal Partnership Agreement between You and Southam Law LLC. In the Legal Partnership Agreement and in these Terms and Conditions, the word “You” means the person or persons who signed the Legal Partnership Agreement, and the word “Agreement” means the Legal Partnership Agreement.

## What is the reason for the Agreement?

The Agreement is a contract between You and Southam Law LLC. In this You are giving Southam Law LLC power of attorney. This gives Southam Law LLC the power and authority to act (or decline to act) in any way that You could act (or decline to act) in order to fulfill the services noted in the Agreement. Southam Law LLC will work through its attorneys, staff members, and contractors to complete the work noted in the Agreement.

## What is included and excluded in the Agreement?

Your Agreement indicates the specific services that are included in Your Agreement. Southam Law LLC agrees only to the services noted in Your Agreement. Your Agreement also lists exclusions, and more details of exclusions is found on the Exclusions and Extra-Cost Services list: https://southamlaw.com/exclusions/. In the event that a service does not appear on Your Agreement or on the Exclusions and Extra-Cost Services list, that service is excluded.

## What are the costs for services and payment schedule?

Your Agreement indicates the total cost of these legal services, the amount of Your initial payment, and the amount of any monthly payments. You agree to pay these fees promptly. You can find more information about how to make a payment on the Payments page: https://southamlaw.com/payment/.

## Will fees increase?

Your Agreement is a fixed fee. The fee will not increase or decrease except in the following circumstances. If You or Southam Law LLC suspends services early, the fee for services may increase or decrease (as noted in the "What happens if You or Southam Law LLC suspends services?" section below). In addition, Southam Law LLC may rarely have to charge fees for urgent translation or urgent mailing services as noted in the Excluded and Extra-Cost Services list: https://southamlaw.com/exclusions/. In addition, if You make and then fail to keep an appointment with a member of Southam Law LLC's staff, You will be charged a missed appointment fee as noted in the Excluded and Extra-Cost Services page. You agree to pay these additional fees if they are incurred.

## How long will the Agreement last?

The Agreement enters into force when You sign it and return it to Southam Law LLC.

The Agreement will continue to have effect and Southam Law LLC will continue to provide services as described in Your Agreement until one of these events happens:

-Approval of Your application or case,<br>
-Denial of Your application or case,<br>
-Suspension of services under this Agreement (by You or by Southam Law LLC), or<br>
-the "Natural End" of Your application or case.

The “Natural End” of services is connected to the type of service. Your Agreement will indicate whether the services consist of preparing and submitting an application or whether the services consist representation at an interview or court hearing. If Your Agreement is for preparing and submitting and application, the “Natural End” of services occurs when immigration officials issue a receipt or acknowledgement of the application or submission. (However, the services will resume if immigration officials issue a “Request for Evidence” or “RFE” in Your application or case.) If Your Agreement is for representation at an interview or court hearing, the “Natural End” of services occurs at the conclusion of the interview or hearing. (However, if the interview or hearing is postponed or cancelled, the “Natural End” occurs when Southam Law LLC or You learn of the postponement or cancellation).

When services have concluded, Southam Law LLC will send You written notice at the last email address and postal address You provided to Southam Law LLC.
